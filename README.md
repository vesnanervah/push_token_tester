# push_by_token_tester

An application that allows you to send a firebase push message on a device by its token.

## Getting Started

1) Retreive service credentials of your Firebase project.
2) Get the device token.
3) Complete any data you want to send.

_TADA! If your device supports FCM, you got service credentials of an app that really exist in firebase and installed on the device and device token really belongs to the device, push should come to you just ok_
